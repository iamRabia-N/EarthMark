## Setup and Usage

To set up a complete flask environment for the EarthMark project, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamRabia-N/EarthMark.git
```

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd EarthMark
```

#### Step 3: Setup Virtual Environment

First, install the `virtualenv` package if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Then, create a new virtual environment named "env" (you can choose any name) using the following command:

```bash
virtualenv env
```

Activate the virtual environment by running the activation script. Note that the command might differ depending on your operating system:

For Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Step 4: Install Flask

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install Flask and its dependencie using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
```


#### Step 5: Start Deploying in Browser


```bash
python app.py
```
